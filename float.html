<p>with a single step, and this is mine. 
    I’ve always believed that knowledge is one of the most 
    powerful tools we can ever hold — and learning to code
    is my way of building something that lasts beyond the 
    present moment. This website isn’t just a collection 
    of words and tags; it’s the foundation of my vision, 
    a space where ideas take shape and creativity meets purpose. 
    As I grow, this page will grow with me — a reminder that progress 
    is made one line of code at a time.
</p>
<p>I am a work in progress — not just in coding, but in life. 
   Every error I fix teaches me patience, every challenge sharpens 
   my thinking, and every success fuels my ambition. This is more than 
   a webpage; it’s a declaration that I refuse to stand still. I’m here 
   to learn, to create, and to leave a mark that speaks louder than my words. 
   The code may be simple today, but the vision behind it is limitless.
