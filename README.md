# Reginatia.github.io. CSS
Starting CSS was something that i really wanted to know, before i started, i was curious about what it was and how much content was in. i felt really good and had confident when during the studies of CSS. i faced alot of challenges, sometimes if i code the thing that was suppose to come does not appear, it doesnt come for mine, but for the video that i was using or learning from, things were going as planned, when this happen, i become really fraustrated, i have to stop, go through everything, because you know how in coding if you dont even bring ;, your whole work will show red, meaning is wrong, so i have to go through the entire coding to see where i miss, and this take a lot of time and attention, because if you dont concentrate on the coding really well, is difficult to find where the error is. Sometimes, i can finish the whole section and if i try to see how it was present, i mean the whole work, it end up not popping up, so i have through go through the whole work. To be honest, when i mastered everything, it became easier and more fun. CSS was quite challenging, but i always stays on track, use the W3 Validator, see my mistakes, and solve it. it has given me an in depth of my understanding now.
